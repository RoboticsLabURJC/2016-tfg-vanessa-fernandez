.TH OMPL_BENCHMARK 1
.SH NAME
ompl_benchmark \- benchmark a motion planning problem with ompl planners
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ompl_benchmark problem.cfg
.SH DESCRIPTION
.BR ompl_benchmark
is a program that parses a YAML configuration file that
specifies a motion planning problem, a list of planner configurations, and
some general benchmark
parameters. The program repeatedly tries to solve the motion planning problem
with each of the planners. It collects various performance metrics which are
saved in a log file. The resulting log file can be processed by
.BR ompl_benchmark_statistics(1)
to create an SQL database and a PDF containing a series of plots that
aggregate the measurements. The YAML configuration files can also be read by
the
.BR ompl_app
GUI, but the GUI only reads the definition of the motion planning problem.
