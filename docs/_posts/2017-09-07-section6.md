* **OMPLapp**

We've installed the OMPLapp. OMPL is a library for non-olonomic movement planning. The installation steps are in the following [link](http://ompl.kavrakilab.org/installation.html).

You may have problems installing OMPL with pip, because OMPL is for Python2 (pip2). The omplapp-1.2.1-Source/py-bindings/generate_bindings.py file have an error. The error was fixed in [1](https://bitbucket.org/ompl/ompl/commits/cc3d0f4).

To launch OMPL.app, execute the ompl_app.py python script, which is found in the omplapp-1.2.1-Source/gui directory. When the GUI is loaded, a window will be presented as in the following image:

* **Autopark: first step with referee**

We've added a first version of referee in autopark's practice. Also, we have marked the robot's way with points.

* **GUI with 3 Lasers in a car (Autopark)**

I've maked the gui of autopark's practice. In this case, the car has a 3 lasers. Each laser have a different color in the GUI.

* **3 Lasers in a car + kobukiViewer**

I've modified the laser's plugin to have 3 lasers in the car. To test its operation we put the taxi in Gazebo, and then we run kobukiViewer. The kobukiViewer tool has been modified to test the taxlLaser's plugin.

* **yellowTaxi with 3 lasers + kobukiViewer**

I've made a new model named taxiLaser. For this I have taken as an example the model yellowTaxi. And I've teleoperated this taxi with kobukiViewer:
