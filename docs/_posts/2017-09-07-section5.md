* **Cars that move alone in different directions and at different speeds**

I've modified the stop.world. Now, there are cars that move in different directions and at different speeds.

* **Cars that move by themselves in the Stop world**

I've maked a world named stop.world in Gazebo. In this world, there are cars that move by themself.

* **Collisions with objects + kobukiViewer**

I've created a world in Gazebo using a .dae file. To create this file I has used the program Sketchup in Windows.In the world I added a turtlebot to teleoperate it with kobukiViewer component.In the following video we can see how it moves the turtlebot when we teleoperate it. When I've created the world I've added a collision mesh for road.Thus the robot doesn't fall.

* **Roads, house and carApriltag in Gazebo**

I created a world called road.world in Gazebo. I have used the car created by Andres Hern√°ndez (carApriltag). I included a house and some roads. I created the roads using coordinates. First, I've included the carMotors.cfg file:

<pre>
    Motors.Endpoints=default -h localhost -p 9999
</pre>

The .word file is as follows:

<pre>
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<sdf version="1.5">
